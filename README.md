## Demo

## Project Status

Current validated scope:

- `wfd` is the primary path and the only mode tested as release-ready.
- `dlna` works as fallback.
- `cast` is experimental and currently not working in the tested Samsung setup.

The project currently focuses on **WFD/Miracast on Linux (Hyprland/wlroots class setups)**.  
DLNA and Cast are available, but they are best treated as fallback or experimental paths.

Current limitation:

- KDE/GNOME Wayland desktop capture uses `xdg-desktop-portal` in WFD mode.
- For portal mode, install Python dependency `dbus-next` and allow screen-share in the desktop picker dialog.

## Quick Start

Default WFD run (interactive monitor/peer selection):

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

WFD with latency/session JSONL log:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --wfd-latency-log
```

DLNA fallback:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --protocol dlna --transport hls
```

Cast mode (optional, if your TV supports it):

```bash
python3 src/main.py --protocol cast
```

Force backend manually (if auto is not suitable on your session):

```bash
python3 src/main.py --capture-backend wf-recorder
python3 src/main.py --capture-backend x11grab
python3 src/main.py --protocol wfd --wfd-capture-backend portal
python3 src/main.py --protocol wfd --wfd-capture-backend wf-recorder
python3 src/main.py --protocol wfd --wfd-capture-backend x11grab
```

Android-based sinks (TV boxes, projectors) that connect but stay on a black
screen:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --protocol wfd --wfd-aosp-pmt-pid
```

WFD P2P connection troubleshooting - talk to wpa_supplicant directly instead
of going through NetworkManager, and optionally pin the group to a 2.4GHz
channel for sinks that don't support Wi-Fi Direct on 5GHz:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --protocol wfd --wfd-p2p-backend wpas
python3 src/main.py --protocol wfd --wfd-p2p-backend wpas --wfd-p2p-channel 6
```

Needs the D-Bus policy in `meta/zz-dev.fluxcast.wpa-supplicant.conf`
installed to `/usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/`. On Debian/Ubuntu, a user in the
`netdev` group can run it without sudo, courtesy of the `netdev` grant in
the distro's own `wpa_supplicant.conf`; elsewhere (including Arch) it falls
back to sudo - see the file for details.

## What Works Best

### WFD (Primary)

```text
screen + audio capture -> H.264/AAC RTP -> Wi-Fi Direct + RTSP -> TV WFD receiver
```

This is the lowest-latency and most predictable path in the current codebase.

### DLNA (Fallback)

```text
desktop capture -> HTTP stream -> DLNA/UPnP AVTransport -> native TV player
```

- Prefer `--transport hls` on Samsung TVs.
- `progressive-ts` can freeze or stutter on some models.

### Cast (Optional)

- Requires a TV/device with real Google Cast support.
- Requires `pychromecast`.
- Not reliable on many Samsung TV models.


## Installation

### AppImage

Download the latest `FluxCast-x86_64.AppImage` from the [Releases](https://github.com/IlyaP358/fluxcast/releases) page, then:

```bash
chmod +x FluxCast-x86_64.AppImage
./FluxCast-x86_64.AppImage
```

On first launch FluxCast will ask for your password once to install a system file for Wi-Fi Direct.

Depending on your desktop environment, you may need to install:
- Hyprland / Sway: `wf-recorder`, `ffmpeg`
- KDE / GNOME: `gst-plugins-ugly` (package name varies by distro)

### Debian / Ubuntu - .deb

Download the `.deb` matching your release from the [Releases](https://github.com/IlyaP358/fluxcast/releases) page and install it:

```bash
sudo apt install ./fluxcast_<version>~<codename>_amd64.deb
```

| Build | Release |
|-------|---------|
| `~bookworm` | Debian 12 |
| `~trixie`   | Debian 13 |
| `~noble`    | Ubuntu 24.04 |
| `~resolute` | Ubuntu 26.04 |

`amd64` only - there is no arm64 build. A release stays in the table for as long
as it has upstream support, and its `.deb` stops being published once that ends.

> [!NOTE]
> Ubuntu builds cover **LTS releases only**. Interim releases are not supported
> and never get their own package.
>
> They are not locked out, though: the builds are gated on the `python3` minor
> version, so pick the one that matches yours and it will install.
>
> ```bash
> python3 --version   # e.g. 3.13.7 on Ubuntu 25.10 -> use the ~trixie build
> ```
>
> | Your `python3` | Build to use |
> |---|---|
> | 3.11 | `~bookworm` |
> | 3.12 | `~noble` |
> | 3.13 | `~trixie` |
> | 3.14 | `~resolute` |
>
> This works because the virtualenv is tied to the Python version rather than
> the distribution, but it is untested and unsupported - bug reports from an
> interim release will most likely be closed as such.

There is no separate privileged step: the package installs the D-Bus policy for
Wi-Fi Direct and reloads dbus for you.

The builds are not interchangeable. FluxCast bundles the Python dependencies
apt does not carry at a usable version (`upnpclient` is absent from the archive,
`python3-pychromecast` is 9.4.0 against a 14.0.5 requirement) in a virtualenv
under `/opt/fluxcast`, and those wheels are tied to the Python version they were
built against. Each package therefore declares the exact `python3` minor version
it was built for, and apt refuses a package whose Python does not match rather
than installing something that fails on first import.

### PyPI

```bash
pip install fluxcast
sudo fluxcast-install-system
```

`fluxcast-install-system` installs the D-Bus policy, desktop entry, and system packages (GStreamer, ffmpeg, NetworkManager, etc.). Run it once after the pip install.


### Arch Linux - AUR

```bash
yay -S fluxcast-git
# or
paru -S fluxcast-git
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlyaP358/fluxcast.git
cd fluxcast
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo meta/install.sh
sudo systemctl reload dbus
sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
```

> [!WARNING]
If `PIP` refuses to install the required libraries to your system, you will need to do that yourself using your distro's package manager.

DLNA/Cast features require additional packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### System tools (just as important)

WFD mode also depends on system binaries, not only Python packages:

- `ffmpeg`
- `wf-recorder` (Wayland/wlroots capture path)
- `xdg-desktop-portal` (+ desktop backend: `xdg-desktop-portal-kde` / `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` / `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`)
- `nmcli`, `gdbus`, `iw`, `wpa_cli` (Wi-Fi Direct and diagnostics)
- `pactl` (audio monitor autodetect)

Use:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --doctor
```

to check your machine before running WFD.

Note: on KDE/GNOME Wayland, WFD auto backend now prefers `portal` first.

Note: on **firewalld** systems, FluxCast opens the WFD RTSP port (`7236/tcp`) for the duration of a session and closes it on exit (no-op without firewalld; disable with `--wfd-no-firewall`). See [DOCUMENTATION.md](documentation/DOCUMENTATION.md) -> "WFD and firewalld".

If you use **ufw**, open the WFD RTSP port before connecting:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 7236/tcp
```
